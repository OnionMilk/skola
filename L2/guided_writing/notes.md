# Guided Writing (Prebac part 2)

Either an informal letter or a speech

## Informal letter:

1. Use the appropriate register:
    * **Who** are you writing/talking to?
    * About what?

2. Write in the correct format:
    * If a letter: -address, date, salutation, sign-off, etc.
	- example: (informal)
	  7, rue M. Welter
	  L-2730
	  15th jan. 2020

	- The above always to the left, if formal then make the address formal with country, city, etc.

	- Paragrafs

## Speech

1. Who is/are the audience?

2. What are you trying to do?
    * Persuade?
    * Sell something?
    * Get elected?
    * Rouse to action?
    * Save the planet?

3. Appropriate language for audience, appropriate address:
    * My lords, ladies and gentlemen, ...
    * Fellow students of the ESL, ...
    * Hi, guys, I'm here to talk about...

4. Use rhetorical devices to convince your audience:
    * Rhetorical questions:
	"Do we really want war?"

    * Alliteration:
	"Cowardly consevatives..."

    * Repetition:
	"Let freedom ring... let freedom ring..."

    * "Triplets":
	*Words/phrases/clauses in threes.*

5. Perforation:
    * The final part of a speech. Make this as dramatic/persuasive/dynamic/humerous (depending on your purpose) as you can.
