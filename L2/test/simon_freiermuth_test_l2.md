HILDEGARD	Wow, this is amazing! This is my chance to take action and make a difference!

WILHELM		Hi Hildegard, What are you so exited about? do you really think you'll actually influence the decisionmakers?

HILDEGARD	What do you mean by "influence the decisionmakers"? It says right here that if i win i'll be the one making
		the decisions, or at least some of them.

WILHELM		No, the only thing you'll be doing is ocasionally stand in front of the class and try to tell the class
		what decision have been made by the grown-ups, while the class is doing anything but paying attention.
